Mode Yllarius works following
const ImgArray = typeof SexActs[Race] !== "undefined" ? typeof SexActs[Race][Act] !== "undefined" ?
	(SexActs[Race][Act][playerGender() + OtherGender()].length > 0 ?
         SexActs[Race][Act][playerGender() + OtherGender()] :
         SexActs[Race][Act][OtherGender()].length > 0 ?
         SexActs[Race][Act][OtherGender()] :
         SexActs[Race][Act].Default.length > 0 ?
         SexActs[Race][Act].Default : []) : [] : [];
Breaking this down we get
1. In folder ImgPack go to folder "SexActs"
2. In folder "SexActs" go to folder "Race", where "Race" equals your enemy/opponents race e.g. Human. Note race is always with out whitespace and first letter only capitalized e.g. "Dark Elf" should be "Darkelf" 
3. in folder "Race" go to folder "Act", where "Act" equals e.g. DoggyStyle.
4. In folder "Act" go to folder OtherGender(enemy gender) + PlayerGender e.g. HH, see gender below.
5. if opponent gender + player gender doesn't have images go to folder opponent gender e.g. H.
6. if opponent gender doesn't have images check if the act folder itself has images and if that fails give up.

Gender:
Herm and Dickgirl = H
Male = M
Female = F
Doll = D
Cuntboy = C

Adding Images:
Place images in appropriate folders once done click on ClickAfterAddingImages.py.
Naming of images should be irrelevant as long as they are jpg or png.
