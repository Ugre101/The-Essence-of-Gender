Mode Yllarius works following:
	SexActs["Race"]["Acts"]["Act"]
	SexActs["Human"]["DoggyStyle"][RandomInt(0,DoggyStyle.lengt-1)]

	myimg.src = `imgPack/${type}/${Race}/${Act}/${playerGender()+OtherGender()}.png`;
Breaking this down we get
1. In folder ImgPack go to folder "type", where "type" equals Category e.g. SexActs or Vore.
2. In folder "type" go to folder "Race", where "Race" equals opponent race e.g. Human. 
3. in folder "Race" go to folder "Act", where "Act" equals e.g. DoggyStyleAnal.
4. In folder "Act" take png or jpg with player gender + opponent gender, see gender below.

Gender:
Herm and Dickgirl = H
Male = M
Female = F
Doll = D
Cuntboy = C

Default / fallback:
if step 4 fails it picks default image in Act folder,
if that fails pick default image in Race folder,
if that fails pick default image in Type folder,
if that fails give up.

Any feedback on bugs or suggestion for improvement if appreciated
