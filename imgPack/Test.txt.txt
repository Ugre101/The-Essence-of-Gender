Mode Yllarius works following:
	myimg.src = `imgPack/${type}/${what}/${d}/${playerGender()+OtherGender()}.png`;
Breaking this down we get
1. In folder ImgPack go to folder "type" where "type" equals Category e.g. SexActs or Vore.
2. In folder "type" go to folder "what" where "what" equals the act e.g. DoggyStyle. 
3. equals a your opponents Race e.g. Human.
4. In folder "what" take png or jpg with player gender + opponent gender, see gender below.

Gender
Herm and Dickgirl = H
Male = M
Female = F
Doll = D
Cuntboy = C
